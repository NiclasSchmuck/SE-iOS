Software Engineering e-Portfolio about the iOS App Development Lifecycle 

## Introduction
Hey everone, 
this weeks e-Portfolio is about developing and deploying an iOS App to the Apple App Store (App Store Connect). I will shortly introduce you into the techniques you should use and which solutions you get provided by Apple.

## Components
The components we are going to use is:

+ Xcode (on Mac)
+ App Store Connect
+ Testflight (on iOS Device)


## Live demo
### Important notice:
To deploy an app to the Apple App Store you need to pay for Apple's Developer Program (costs $99 a year). xCode is only available for mac os. 

### Get started
Have a look into the git repository if you want to use my example code. 
This example application is loading an json File locally into a codable structure (you will learn what that exactly is) and insert it into a list using SwiftUI. 

##How to import?
1. If you want to import my Code into your own Xcode, you firstly have to create a project by File -> New -> Project
2. Select Single View App
3. Name it, add your organisation Team, and choose the User Interface SwiftUI.
4. Check Include UI Tests & Include Unit Tests (if unchecked only)
5. After the project is created, please copy ContentView.swift, StructureExample.swift as well as persons.json into your project.
6. If you want to add my example Test, please copy this file into your UITests Folder.

If there occures an error, please contact me via WhatsApp or Discord.

Cheers
